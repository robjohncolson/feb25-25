# Scaffolded Practice Problems for Assessment Questions 1-4

## Problem 1 Scaffolding: Function Transformations

### Scaffold 1.1: Basic Translations
The graph of $y = |x|$ has its vertex at $(0, 0)$. What is the vertex of each transformed function?

a) $y = |x - 3|$ has vertex at $(\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_)$
b) $y = |x| - 5$ has vertex at $(\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_)$
c) $y = |x + 2| + 1$ has vertex at $(\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_)$

### Scaffold 1.2: Identifying Transformations
Match each transformation to its effect on the graph:

| Transformation | Effect |
|---|---|
| $f(x - h)$ where $h > 0$ | A. Moves graph up |
| $f(x) + k$ where $k > 0$ | B. Moves graph down |
| $f(x) - k$ where $k > 0$ | C. Moves graph right |
| $f(x + h)$ where $h > 0$ | D. Moves graph left |

### Scaffold 1.3: Combined Transformations
The function $f(x) = |x + 1|$ has vertex at $(-1, 0)$. Find the vertex after these transformations:

a) Translate 2 units right: vertex at $(\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_)$
b) Then translate 3 units down: vertex at $(\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_)$

What is the equation of the final transformed function? $y = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_$

### Scaffold 1.4: Reflection and Translation
The graph of $y = -|x + 2| + 3$ is shown. If this graph is translated 5 units right and 6 units down, what is the equation of the new graph?

Original vertex: $(-2, 3)$
New vertex after translation: $(\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_)$
New equation: $y = \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_$

## Problem 2 Scaffolding: Vertical Asymptotes

### Scaffold 2.1: Understanding Vertical Asymptotes
A vertical asymptote occurs when the denominator of a rational function equals zero but the numerator does not.

For each function, find where the denominator equals zero:

a) $f(x) = \frac{1}{x - 3}$ has vertical asymptote at $x = \_\_\_\_$
b) $f(x) = \frac{2}{x + 5}$ has vertical asymptote at $x = \_\_\_\_$
c) $f(x) = \frac{x}{x - 7}$ has vertical asymptote at $x = \_\_\_\_$

### Scaffold 2.2: Logarithmic Functions Domain
The domain of $\ln(x)$ is $x > 0$. Find the domain of each function and identify any vertical asymptotes:

a) $f(x) = \ln(x - 2)$
   Domain: $x > \_\_\_\_$
   Vertical asymptote: $x = \_\_\_\_$

b) $f(x) = \ln(x + 1)$
   Domain: $x > \_\_\_\_$
   Vertical asymptote: $x = \_\_\_\_$

c) $f(x) = \log(x - 6)$
   Domain: $x > \_\_\_\_$
   Vertical asymptote: $x = \_\_\_\_$

### Scaffold 2.3: Identifying Asymptotes in Transformed Logs
For each function, determine if there is a vertical asymptote at $x = 4$:

a) $f(x) = \log(x - 4)$ □ Yes □ No
b) $f(x) = \log(x + 4)$ □ Yes □ No
c) $f(x) = \log(x) - 4$ □ Yes □ No
d) $f(x) = 4\log(x)$ □ Yes □ No

### Scaffold 2.4: Multiple Choice Practice
Which of these functions has a vertical asymptote at $x = 4$?

A. $f(x) = \log_2(x) - 4$
B. $f(x) = \ln(x - 4) + 1$
C. $f(x) = 3\log(x) + 4$
D. $f(x) = \log(x + 4) - 2$

## Problem 3 Scaffolding: Work Rate Problems

### Scaffold 3.1: Understanding Rates
If a faucet can fill a tank in 6 hours, what fraction of the tank does it fill in 1 hour?

Rate = $\frac{1}{6}$ of the tank per hour

Complete these:
a) If a faucet fills a tank in 4 hours, its rate is $\frac{\_\_\_\_}{\_\_\_\_}$ of the tank per hour
b) If a faucet fills a tank in 8 hours, its rate is $\frac{\_\_\_\_}{\_\_\_\_}$ of the tank per hour
c) If a faucet fills a tank in $t$ hours, its rate is $\frac{\_\_\_\_}{\_\_\_\_}$ of the tank per hour

### Scaffold 3.2: Adding Rates
When two faucets work together, their rates add up.

Example: Faucet A fills $\frac{1}{6}$ of the tank per hour, Faucet B fills $\frac{1}{3}$ of the tank per hour.
Together they fill: $\frac{1}{6} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{1}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}$ of the tank per hour.

So together they fill the tank in 2 hours.

Practice:
a) Faucet A: 4 hours alone, rate = $\frac{\_\_\_\_}{\_\_\_\_}$ per hour
b) Faucet B: 12 hours alone, rate = $\frac{\_\_\_\_}{\_\_\_\_}$ per hour
c) Combined rate = $\frac{\_\_\_\_}{\_\_\_\_} + \frac{\_\_\_\_}{\_\_\_\_} = \frac{\_\_\_\_}{\_\_\_\_}$ per hour
d) Time to fill together = \_\_\_\_ hours

### Scaffold 3.3: Setting Up the Equation
If Faucet A takes $a$ hours and Faucet B takes $b$ hours to fill a tank alone, the equation for the time $t$ it takes them together is:

$\frac{1}{a} + \frac{1}{b} = \frac{1}{t}$

Set up (but don't solve) the equation for these scenarios:
a) Faucet A: 5 hours, Faucet B: 10 hours
   Equation: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

b) Faucet A: 6 hours, Faucet B: 9 hours
   Equation: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### Scaffold 3.4: Solving Work Problems
Solve: $\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{t}$

Step 1: Find common denominator for left side
$\frac{1}{8} + \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{8} + \frac{\_\_\_\_}{8} = \frac{\_\_\_\_}{8}$

Step 2: Solve for $t$
$\frac{\_\_\_\_}{8} = \frac{1}{t}$

Therefore: $t = \frac{8}{\_\_\_\_} = \_\_\_\_$ hours

Convert to hours and minutes: \_\_\_\_ hours and \_\_\_\_ minutes

c) $f(x) = -2(x - 4)^2 + 7$ has vertex $(\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_)$

### Scaffold 4.2: Horizontal Translations

a) $g(x) = f(x - 1)$ (shifts right 1 unit)
   New vertex: $(\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_)$

b) $h(x) = f(x + 2)$ (shifts left 2 units)
   New vertex: $(\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_)$

c) $j(x) = f(x - 5)$ (shifts right 5 units)
   New vertex: $(\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_)$

### Scaffold 4.3: Vertical Translations
If $f(x)$ has vertex at $(2, -4)$, find the vertex of each transformed function:

a) $g(x) = f(x) + 3$ (shifts up 3 units)
   New vertex: $(\_\_\_\_, \_\_\_\_)$
